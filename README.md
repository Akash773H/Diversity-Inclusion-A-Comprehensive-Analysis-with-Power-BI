In this project, I developed a Power BI dashboard to analyze and visualize diversity and inclusion within Pharma Group AG, leveraging a comprehensive dataset to uncover valuable insights. The analysis focuses on various dimensions of the workforce, including gender distribution, job levels after promotions, performance ratings, promotion trends, and demographic details.

Job Levels and Promotions: Examined the distribution of employees across various job levels after FY20 promotions, highlighting trends in career progression and promotion rates.
Performance Ratings: Assessed performance ratings across different job levels and genders to identify patterns and areas for improvement.
Promotion Trends: Investigated the promotion rates in FY20 and FY21, focusing on the impact of gender and performance ratings on promotion likelihood.
Demographic Analysis: Explored age groups, nationalities, and regions to understand the diversity within the organization and identify potential areas for targeted inclusion efforts.

Key Insights:

Performance and Promotions: Revealed the correlation between performance ratings and promotion rates, emphasizing the importance of performance management in career development.
Diversity by Demographics: Uncovered trends in age and nationality distribution, providing a foundation for strategic diversity initiatives and policies.
Interactive Dashboard:

The Power BI dashboard offers interactive visualizations, enabling users to explore the data dynamically and gain actionable insights.
Key features include filterable charts, drill-down capabilities, and detailed reports on specific demographic segments.

Implications and Recommendations:

Strategic Diversity Initiatives: Based on the analysis, recommend targeted initiatives to address gender imbalances and enhance diversity across job levels and functions.
